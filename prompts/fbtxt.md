## q: can you design a human (but parseable) football plain text format from scratch learning from the rsssf quirks and best and worst practicies?

This is a great challenge—and honestly, RSSSF is the perfect “what not to do / what to preserve” case study.

Let’s design a **human-friendly, plain-text football format** that:

* keeps RSSSF’s readability
* removes ambiguity
* is trivially parseable (no guesswork)
* survives messy real-world data

I’ll call it:

# 🧾 **FTXT (Football Text Format)**

*A structured plain-text format inspired by RSSSF, but machine-safe*

---

# 🧠 Design principles (learned from RSSSF)

### ✅ Keep (good RSSSF traits)

* human-readable
* compact
* chronological flow
* minimal syntax overhead

### ❌ Fix (RSSSF pain points)

* inconsistent date formats
* ambiguous match lines
* free-form notes mixed with data
* multiple formats for same concept

---

# 🧱 Core idea

Every line is one of:

* **header**
* **entity definition**
* **match**
* **event**
* **annotation**

Each has a **clear prefix token** → no guessing.

---

# 🔤 1) Global structure

```id="fmt1"
@competition: UEFA Champions League
@season: 1998/99
@country: Europe
@type: knockout

# Round: Semi-finals

...
```

### Rules:

* `@` = metadata (key:value)
* `#` = section headers
* no free text outside defined structures

---

# ⚽ 2) Match line (core unit)

```id="fmt2"
M|1999-05-12|Manchester United|Juventus|1-1
```

### Format:

```
M|DATE|HOME|AWAY|HOME_SCORE-AWAY_SCORE
```

### Why this works:

* pipe-separated → trivial parsing
* fixed column order
* no ambiguity

---

# ➕ 3) Optional match extensions

Append key-value pairs:

```id="fmt3"
M|1999-05-12|Manchester United|Juventus|1-1|et=0|pens=0|status=played
```

---

# 🎯 4) Events (goals, cards, etc.)

```id="fmt4"
E|goal|Manchester United|Dwight Yorke|45+1
E|goal|Juventus|Inzaghi|60
```

### Format:

```
E|TYPE|TEAM|PLAYER|MINUTE
```

### Extensions:

```id="fmt5"
E|card|Juventus|Davids|72|card=yellow
E|goal|Manchester United|Giggs|90|type=penalty
```

---

# 🔁 5) Multi-leg ties (clean solution)

```id="fmt6"
T|Semi-finals|Manchester United|Juventus|agg=3-2|winner=Manchester United|method=aggregate
```

Matches follow:

```id="fmt7"
M|1999-04-21|Juventus|Manchester United|1-1|leg=1|tie=1
M|1999-05-05|Manchester United|Juventus|2-1|leg=2|tie=1
```

---

# 🧾 6) Notes (controlled, not chaotic)

```id="fmt8"
N|match|1999-05-12|Match replayed after protest
N|team|Juventus|Played home matches in Milan
```

### Format:

```
N|ENTITY_TYPE|REFERENCE|TEXT
```

---

# 🏟️ 7) Optional metadata blocks

```id="fmt9"
A|match|1999-05-12|attendance=65000
A|match|1999-05-12|stadium=Old Trafford
A|match|1999-05-12|referee=Pierluigi Collina
```

---

# 🧩 8) Team normalization (built-in support)

```id="fmt10"
@team: Manchester United|country=England
@alias: Man United|Manchester United
@alias: Man Utd|Manchester United
```

---

# 📊 9) Full example (realistic)

```id="fmt11"
@competition: UEFA Champions League
@season: 1998/99
@type: knockout

# Round: Semi-finals

T|Semi-finals|Manchester United|Juventus|agg=3-2|winner=Manchester United

M|1999-04-21|Juventus|Manchester United|1-1|leg=1|tie=1
E|goal|Juventus|Inzaghi|25
E|goal|Manchester United|Giggs|50

M|1999-05-05|Manchester United|Juventus|2-1|leg=2|tie=1
E|goal|Juventus|Inzaghi|11
E|goal|Manchester United|Keane|24
E|goal|Manchester United|Yorke|84

A|match|1999-05-05|attendance=55000
N|match|1999-05-05|Roy Keane suspended for final
```

# 🔍 Why this format works

## ✅ Human-friendly

* readable like RSSSF
* chronological
* minimal symbols

## ✅ Machine-friendly

* every line starts with a type token
* pipe-separated → no regex nightmares
* no ambiguity in structure

## ✅ Handles RSSSF quirks

| Problem               | Solution         |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| multiple date formats | ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| weird minute formats  | stored as text   |
| replay/abandoned      | `status=`        |
| aggregate ties        | `T` records      |
| notes everywhere      | `N` lines        |
| inconsistent naming   | `@alias`         |

# ⚖️ Trade-offs (honest assessment)

### What you lose vs RSSSF

* free-form storytelling
* ultra-compact prose

### What you gain

* **100% parseability**
* consistency across decades
* easy database ingestion

---

# 🚀 Bonus: why this beats CSV/JSON

### vs CSV

* supports hierarchy (rounds, ties)
* supports multiple record types

### vs JSON

* human-editable
* diff-friendly (Git)
* readable in plain text

---

# 🧭 If you wanted to evolve this further

You could add:

* IDs (`match_id`, `team_id`)
* versioning
* validation schema (JSON Schema equivalent)

---

# 👉 If you want next step

I can:

* write a **formal grammar (EBNF) for FTXT**, or
* show a **parser that converts FTXT → SQL database**, or
* convert a real RSSSF page into this format

That’s where you really see how much cleaner this becomes.



## q: thanks. can you try a more human (compact) format / version that looks more like free-style text?

You can push this quite a bit further toward “RSSSF-like prose” *without* falling back into chaos—but you have to be disciplined about a few invisible rules.

Let’s design a second variant:

# 🧾 **FTXT-Lite (free-style but parseable)**

Think of it as:

> **“looks like RSSSF, parses like a log file”**

---

# 🧠 Core idea

Instead of rigid pipes everywhere, we use:

* **natural lines**
* **consistent punctuation anchors**
* **light keywords**
* **strict patterns under the hood**

So a human sees prose—but a parser sees structure.

---

# 🔤 1) Global structure

```id="lite1"
UEFA Champions League 1998/99

Semi-finals
```

👉 No symbols needed here—context is clear from position.

---

# ⚽ 2) Match lines (compact, readable)

```id="lite2"
1999-04-21  Juventus 1–1 Manchester United
1999-05-05  Manchester United 2–1 Juventus
```

### Hidden rules:

* date always first (ISO → parse anchor)
* score always `X–Y` (en dash or hyphen allowed, but fixed)
* exactly two team names around score

👉 This is already **90% parseable without markers**

---

# 🎯 3) Events (inline, but structured)

```id="lite3"
  [25' Inzaghi] [50' Giggs]
  [11' Inzaghi] [24' Keane] [84' Yorke]
```

### Rules:

* events always inside `[...]`
* format: `[minute' player]`
* multiple events = sequence of brackets

👉 Very human, but still tokenizable

---

# 🔁 4) Aggregate / tie info (natural sentence, fixed keywords)

```id="lite4"
Manchester United beat Juventus 3–2 on aggregate.
```

### Parsing trick:

* keyword: **“on aggregate”**
* score pattern still `X–Y`

---

# 🧾 5) Notes (free text—but tagged subtly)

```id="lite5"
! Roy Keane suspended for final
! Match replayed after protest
```

👉 Rule:

* `!` at start = note
* everything after = free text

---

# 🏟️ 6) Optional match metadata (inline, compact)

```id="lite6"
1999-05-05  Manchester United 2–1 Juventus (att: 55000, ref: Collina)
```

### Rules:

* parentheses = metadata
* `key: value` pairs separated by commas

---

# 🧩 7) Minimal team normalization (still human)

```id="lite7"
Manchester United (aka Man United, Man Utd)
```

---

# 📊 8) Full example

```id="lite8"
UEFA Champions League 1998/99

Semi-finals

1999-04-21  Juventus 1–1 Manchester United
  [25' Inzaghi] [50' Giggs]

1999-05-05  Manchester United 2–1 Juventus (att: 55000)
  [11' Inzaghi] [24' Keane] [84' Yorke]

Manchester United beat Juventus 3–2 on aggregate.

! Roy Keane suspended for final
```

---

# 🔍 Why this works

## ✅ Feels like RSSSF

* almost identical visually
* no heavy syntax
* readable as plain football notes

## ✅ Still parseable (key anchors)

| Element   | Anchor                    |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| match     | line starts with ISO date |
| score     | `X–Y` pattern             |
| events    | `[ ... ]` blocks          |
| aggregate | phrase “on aggregate”     |
| notes     | `!` prefix                |
| metadata  | `(key: value)`            |

---

# ⚠️ Where this can break (honest limits)

This format is **not bulletproof** unless you enforce:

* ISO dates only
* consistent score separator
* no stray brackets outside events
* no mixing commentary into match lines

If you relax those → you’re back in RSSSF land.

---

# ⚖️ Comparison with strict FTXT

| Feature           | FTXT (strict) | FTXT-Lite      |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| readability       | medium        | high           |
| parseability      | perfect       | high (~90–95%) |
| flexibility       | low           | medium         |
| risk of ambiguity | none          | small          |

---

# 🧠 Key insight

You can get very close to “free text” if you ensure:

> **every important concept has ONE unmistakable visual pattern**

That’s the entire trick.

---

# 🚀 If you want to push this further

We can:

* define a **formal parsing grammar for FTXT-Lite**
* add support for:

  * group tables
  * standings
  * player stats
* or convert a real RSSSF page into this style (you’ll see how clean it becomes)
